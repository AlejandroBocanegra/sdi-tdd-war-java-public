1. Install Java here: [Java8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html).
To confirm, run `java -version`. The computer should display `java version "1.8.0_XX".

2. Install [Gradle](http://www.gradle.org/) using `brew update` then `brew install gradle`. 
To confirm, run `gradle -version`. The computer should display `Gradle 2.XX`.


#Objectives

* Review Javascript Cars tests and solutions
* cd into javascript/cars then:
* Run jasmine to confirm the tests are passing

* Review Java Cars tests
* Translate the solutions for Javascript into Java
* Within the root of the Java folder run `gradle test` to test your results

# Once you are finished translating tests, add tests for the following user stories:

- As a driver, I want my car to save my six favorite radio stations 
- As a driver, I want to be able to select the radio station from a list of my favorite stations to listen to 
- As a driver, I want to be able to fill up my gas tank 
- As a driver, I want to be able to see how much gas is in my tank
- As a car, I want my gas tank to decrease by .5% with each mile driven 
- As a car, I want to alert the driver when there is only 10% gas remaining so they fill it up
